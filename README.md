# Country App

https://countries-one-nu.vercel.app/

##
<b>A Country Info App which provides information about a country like its capital, flag, weather etc  which are taken from https://restcountries.com/ and https://openweathermap.org/api respectively.

##

You can use this as a template and make your own Country app with React which is better and more innovative  than mine.  🤓 🤩 🥳

##

This app was initialised with Create React App 😇 which is a package of React 🤩 built by FaceBook 🙃

##

This project was done when i was beginner 😅 so feel free to modify it and make it better 🤓  and you will be added as a contibutor/creator 😎.
